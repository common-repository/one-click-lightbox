Just activate the Plugin and add a Link to the Media File to all your images and you're done!

One Click Lightbox works with .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp and .gif!
The width and height of the Lightbox resizes automatically for each image.

If you want more than that, you can just edit the settings on the settings page:
